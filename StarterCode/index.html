          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Overall, there is a positive correlation between poverty levels and percent obesity within states. As the 
            percentage of the population living under the poverty line increases, so does the percentage of residents
            considered obese. 
          </p>

          <p>If this correlation represents a cause and effect relationship between poverty and obesity, there are 
            several potential explanations that could be explored. For example, areas of high poverty are more likely
            to occur in food deserts. Areas with few grocery stores force residents to depend on fast food, convenience
            stores, and bodegas, all of which provide more processed food and less healthy food. It would be informative 
            to look for an association between food deserts and obesity.  </p>

          <p>Alternatively, even within areas rich in geocery stores, the food choices in those stoers are not equal. Given
            the high subsidies of corn and corn derived products, such as corn syrup, one can easily buy large amounts of 
            processed, less healthy food for the same amount of money as smaller amounts of fresh, healthy food. Finally, 
            living below the poverty line will also decrease access to health insurance, access to healthcare, and preventative
            care, all of which might increase prevalence toward a range of health conditions, including obesity. A correlation
            between healthcare and poverty could also be interrogated with this dataset.
